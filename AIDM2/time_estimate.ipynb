    "This assignment is concerned with finding the set of similar users in the provided datasource. To be more explicit, in finding all pairs of users who have a Jaccard similarity of more than 0.5. Additionally, this assignment considers comparing the \"na誰ve implementation\" with the \"LSH implementation\". The \"na誰ve implementation\" can be found in the file `time_estimate.ipynb` and the \"LSH implementation\" in the file `lsh.ipynb`.\n",

    "#### **Na誰ve Implementation**\n",
    "This notebook implements a na誰ve algorithm to find all pairs of users with a Jaccard similarity of more than 0.5. As noted in the assignment instructions the duration of the algorithm might be far to great to ever achieve execution in a reasonable time. As such, this file includes tests in order to extrapolate and estimate what the total run time of a full execution would be. This estimate is also the only output delivered by this notebook."
