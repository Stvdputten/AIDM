    "### **Assignment 2**\n",
    "This assignment is concerned with finding the set of similar users in the provided datasource. To be more explicit, in finding all pairs of users who have a Jaccard similarity of more than 0.5. Additionally, this assignment considers comparing the \"naïve implementation\" with the \"LSH implementation\". The \"naïve implementation\" can be found in the file `time_estimate.ipynb` and the \"LSH implementation\" in the file `lsh.ipynb`.\n",

    "#### **LSH Implementation**\n",
    "This notebook implements LSH in order to find all pairs of users with a Jaccard similarity of more than 0.5. As noted in the assignment instructions the data file is loaded from `user_movie.npy` and the list of user pairs are printed in the file `ans.txt`. Additionally, this implementation supports the setting of a random seed to determine the permutations to be used in LSH. The algorithm will continually save its output so as to aid in the evluation criteria which only looks at the first 15 minutes of the LSH execution.\n",
